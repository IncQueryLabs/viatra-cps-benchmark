2. Add the VIATRA CPS Demonstrator project (see https://github.com/viatra/viatra-docs/blob/master/cps/Contributor-Guide.adoc for details)
3. Add the benchmark setup URL as well: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/viatra/viatra-cps-benchmark/master/setup/com.incquerylabs.examples.cps.setup/viatra-cps-benchmark.setup
4. Check the `VIATRA CPS Demo` and `CPS Benchmark` projects
5. Use the drop-down menus for each field on the Variables page to select the appropriate choices
